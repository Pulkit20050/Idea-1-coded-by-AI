Its the idea related to focused streaming, we are fortunate that we can watch anything around the world,
through YouTube platforms, but as a commercial service sector, its meant for all sorts of audience, and hence
the accountability to stay focused is low. When we are watching one video we see tons of other videos at side, explore section
and hence we get the urge and curiosity, "we should see it its interesting", but one thing to note, Youtube isn't the only site,
we also have bigthink, ted, internet archive, and wikipedia. For reading and watching videos. And what's the motive here when you go 
to this tool, its minimal, no ads, videos, just a simple search, and which site you want to visit.
You can also quotes that inspires you, and the suggested reads, as it makes it even more convenient to get your exploration done without
spending much energy.
